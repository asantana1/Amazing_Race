# Amazing_Race
A racing game written in Java

A 2d racing game that I worked on during college. It displays four cars in a square racing venue. They lap the racing venue,
once all cars reach the finish line, the race ends.

This is a game I would like to improve, such as adding user interaction, more functionality, etc.
